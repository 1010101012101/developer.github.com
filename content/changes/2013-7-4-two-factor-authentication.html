Two factor authentication has been added to GitHub. This means that users with
two factor authentication enabled will no longer be able to authenticate using
only their username and password. What does this mean for you? If you are using
Basic Authentication, you will need to update your code to work with two factor
authentication. We have provided two authentication flows to enable this.

The first option is to send the users' one time password (OTP) along with the
Basic Authentication. To do this, send a `X-GitHub-OTP` header containing the
user's OTP in addition to sending the normal Basic Auth credentials.

The second option is to do basic authentication with the user's Personal Access
Tokens. Users can create these tokens by visiting [the application settings
page](https://github.com/settings/applications). These can be provided in the
Basic Authentication header instead of a password.
