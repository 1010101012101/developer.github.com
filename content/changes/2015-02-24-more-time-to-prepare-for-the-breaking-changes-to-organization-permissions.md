After listening to your feedback on the upcoming [breaking changes to organization permissions][org-permissions-preview], we've decided to give developers more time to update their applications. We'll announce a specific date once we've decided on one.

In the meantime, if your application relies on any of the affected functionality described in our [previous blog post][org-permissions-preview], please **update your code** to account for these changes. If you have any questions or feedback, please [get in touch with us][contact]!
