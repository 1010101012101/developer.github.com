For the past few weeks, the new [Organization Membership][org-membership-api] and [Team Membership][team-membership-api] APIs have been available for early access via a preview media type.  As of today, these APIs are stable and suitable for production use.

On **September 22nd, 2014**, these APIs will become official parts of the GitHub API v3. At that time, the preview media type will no longer be required to access these APIs, and the [breaking changes to the "Add team member" endpoint][add-team-member] will go into effect for all requests.

If you have any questions or feedback, please [get in touch with us][contact]!
