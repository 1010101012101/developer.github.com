We want to make it easier to get started with [webhooks][webhooks]! Today, weâ€™ve added example webhook
payloads to the [event types][event-types] page. Now, alongside existing descriptions for each event,
we include a [full example payload][full-payload] you would receive.

If you have any questions or feedback, please [get in touch][get-in-touch].
