[GitHub Enterprise](https://enterprise.github.com) offers the same set of APIs as GitHub.com, as well as its own set of unique functionality.

We've just brought over the documentation for the Enterprise Admin APIs from [the Enterprise Help site](https://enterprise.github.com/help) to their own [first-class support here on this website](https://developer.github.com/v3/enterprise/).

In the coming weeks, we'll also be [providing more guides](https://developer.github.com/guides/) on how you can effectively use this API in your company. Is there a workflow you're particularly interested in? [Let us know](https://github.com/contact?form%5Bsubject%5D=Suggestion+for+an+Enterprise+Guide)!
