As we [iterate on the preview][january-deployment-api-post] for the new Deployment API, we're still fleshing out the underlying schema that will help people deliver software better with GitHub. We've already [updated the payload][payload-update] that integrations can use to customize deployment meta information. We're also integrating with the [combined status API][combined-statuses] to help ensure only tested and verified code gets deployed.

We've decided to extend the deployment API preview by another 60 days in order to make sure that everything works well with the changes we've been introducing to the API.  As always, if you have any questions or feedback, please [get in touch][contact].
