### About the Search API

The Search API is optimized to help you find the specific item you're looking
for (e.g., a specific user, a specific file in a repository, etc.). Think of it
the way you think of performing a search on Google. It's designed to help you
find the one result you're looking for (or maybe the few results you're looking
for). Just like searching on Google, you sometimes want to see a few pages of
search results so that you can find the item that best meets your needs. To
satisfy that need, the GitHub Search API provides **up to 1,000 results for each
search**.

### Rate limit

The Search API has a custom rate limit. For requests using [Basic
Authentication](/v3/#authentication), [OAuth](/v3/#authentication), or [client
ID and secret](/v3/#unauthenticated-rate-limited-requests), you can make up to
20 requests per minute. For unauthenticated requests, the rate limit allows you
to make up to 5 requests per minute.

See the [rate limit documentation](/v3/#rate-limiting) for details on
determining your current rate limit status.

## Search repositories

Find repositories via various criteria. (This method returns up to 100 results [per page](/v3/#pagination).)

    GET /search/repositories

### Parameters

q
: The search terms. This can be any combination of the existing repository search parameters:

   * [Search In](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-repositories#search-in)
     Qualifies which fields are searched. With this qualifier you can restrict the
     search to just the repository name, description, readme, or
     any combination of these.
   * [Size](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-repositories#size)
      Finds repositories that match a certain size (in kilobytes)
   * [Forks](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-repositories#forks)
      Specifies the number of forks a repository could have
   * [Created and Last Updated](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-repositories#created-and-last-updated) dates
      Filters repositories based on times of creation, or when they were last updated
   * [Users or Repositories](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-repositories#users-organizations-and-repositories)
      Limits searches to a specific user or repository
   * [Languages](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-repositories#languages)
      Searches repositories based on what language they're written in.
   * [Stars](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-repositories#stars)
      Searches repositories based on the number of stars

sort
: _Optional_ Sort field. One of `stars`, `forks`, or `updated`. If not
provided, results are sorted by best match.

order
: _Optional_ Sort order if `sort` param is provided. One of `asc` or `desc`; the default is `desc`.

<h4 id="repository-search-example">Example</h4>

Suppose you want to search for popular Tetris repositories written in Assembly.
Your query might look like this.

```
https://api.github.com/search/repositories?q=tetris+language:assembly&sort=stars&order=desc
```

In this request, we're searching for repositories with the word `tetris` in the
name, the description, or the README. We're limiting the results to only find
repositories where the primary language is Assembly. We're sorting by stars in
descending order, so that the most popular repositories appear first in the
search results.

<%= headers 200 %>
<%= json(:repo_search_v3_results) %>

### Highlighting Repository Searches

You can enable highlighting in your results by specifying the `text-match` media
type in your Accept header. For example, via curl, the above query would look like this:


    curl -H 'Accept: application/vnd.github.text-match+json' \
         https://api.github.com/search/repositories?q=tetris+language:assembly&sort=stars&order=desc


This produces the same JSON payload as above, with an extra key called `text_matches`,
an array of objects. These objects provide information such as the position of your
search terms within the text, as well as the property that it was matched against.

You can highlight the **name** and **description** fields in your results. Here's
an example response:

<%= json(:repo_search_v3_results_highlighting) %>

## Search code

Find file contents via various criteria. (This method returns up to 100 results [per page](/v3/#pagination).)

    GET /search/code

### Parameters

q
: The search terms. This can be any combination of the existing code search parameters:

   * [Search In](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-code#search-in)
     Qualifies which fields are searched. With this qualifier you can restrict the
     search to just the file contents, the file path, or both.
   * [Languages](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-code#language)
      Searches code based on what language it's written in
   * [Forks](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-code#forks)
      Specifies the number of forks a hosting repository could have
   * [Size](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-code#size)
      Finds files that match a certain size (in kilobytes)
   * [Path](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-code#path)
      Specifies the path that the resulting file must be at
   * [Extension](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-code#extension)
      Matches files with a certain extension
   * [Users or Repositories](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-code#users-organizations-and-repositories)
      Limits searches to a specific user or repository

sort
: _Optional_ Sort field. Can only be `indexed`, which indicates how recently
a file has been indexed by the GitHub search infrastructure. If not
provided, results are sorted by best match.

order
: _Optional_ Sort order if `sort` param is provided. One of `asc` or `desc`; the default is `desc`.

<h4 id="code-search-example">Example</h4>

Suppose you want to find recently-updated Ruby gems that are using the `octokit`
library. Your query might look like this:

```
https://api.github.com/search/code?q=octokit+in:file+extension:gemspec+-repo:octokit/octokit.rb&sort=indexed
```

Here, we're searching for the keyword `octokit` within a file's contents. We're
making sure that we're only looking in files that end in _.gemspec_. The `-repo`
notation ensures that we're also excluding [the Octokit.rb repo](https://github.com/octokit/octokit.rb).
Weâ€™re sorting by `indexed`, so that the most recently-indexed repositories
appear first in the search results.

<%= json(:code_search_v3_results) %>

### Highlighting Code Searches

You can enable highlighting in your results by specifying the `text-match` media

search terms within the text, as well as the property that it was matched against.
