Every GitHub repository has the option to communicate with a web server whenever
the repository is pushed to. These "webhooks" can be used to update an external
issue tracker, trigger CI builds, update a backup mirror, or even deploy to your
production server.

This section of the GitHub Developer Guide will instruct you on how to develop, configure,
and test your first web hook.
