Every GitHub repository has the option to communicate with a web server whenever 
the repository is pushed to. These "WebHooks" can be used to update an external 
issue tracker, trigger CI builds, update a backup mirror, or even deploy to your 
production server.

Follow the instructions in this guide to learn all about developing, testing,
and installing web hooks in your repositories!
